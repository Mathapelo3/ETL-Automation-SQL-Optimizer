# ETL Automation & SQL Optimizer

## Project Description
This project automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and optimizes SQL queries by analyzing slow query logs and suggesting indexing strategies. The goal is to reduce database query execution times and automate data pipeline tasks to improve performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- SQL
- MySQL/PostgreSQL (or other DBMS)
- Regular Expressions

## Features
- Extracts and processes raw transactional data into a cleaned and structured format.
- Loads transformed data into a database for reporting and analysis.
- Suggests indexing strategies to optimize slow queries based on the provided logs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MySQL/PostgreSQL or any SQL-based database
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl-sql-optimizer.git
    cd etl-sql-optimizer
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. To run the ETL process:
    ```bash
    python etl.py
    ```
2. To optimize SQL queries, provide a slow query log and run:
    ```bash
    python sql_optimizer.py --log /path/to/slow-query.log
    ```
